<h1>A Tale of Five Interviewers</h1>
<p>Andrew Cherry just had an interview and
<a target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/win_tech_off_topic/message/1428">
posted his experience</a> to the Windows Off Topic Mailing List:</p>
<p>I had five interviewers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First: 3 Programming questions</li>
  <li>Second: Explain my current major programming assignment at work (in 
  detail), 2 programming questions</li>
  <li>Third: 1 Logic Problem (reasonably simple, once I got my brain working), 
then 1 programming question</li>
  <li>Fourth: Explain difference between arrays and linked lists and where you 
would use them (drawbacks to being a soon-to-be college grad), then five or six 
smaller programming questions</li>
  <li>Fifth: ONE programming question in an hour interview. Then the hard stuff. 
*shudder*</li>
</ul>
<p>DAMN! I just went through your site! My logic problem is listed!!! I could 
have been faster on it!!! Stinkin' luck...</p>
<p>And the &quot;thinking&quot; question from that !@$#@@ fifth interviewer... &quot;Why do you 
want to work at Microsoft?&quot; -- to which NONE of my reasons was apparently good 
enough....</p>
