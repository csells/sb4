            Microsoft Interview Study Materials
        </h1>
        If you simply must study for your Microsoft interview, I recommend <b>Ace the 
            Technical Interview,</b> by Michael Rothstein. It offers basic and advanced 
        questions on Microsoft-related technical topics like C and C++, client/server 
        architectures, object-oriented analysis, design and programming and Visual 
        Basic. It also has a good overview section for the socially challenged who'll 
        have trouble with questions like &quot;Why did you leave your last job?&quot; 
        (try answering that question without using the words &quot;boredom&quot; or 
        &quot;hatred.&quot;)
        <p>
        I also recommend breaking out your freshman algorithms and data structures text 
        books. I favor Sahni and Knuth myself, but nearly anything that hurts to read 
        should do.<p align="left">

        <blockquote>&quot;They have a bunch of logic puzzles (okay, well, mostly logic puzzles) 
        that could be used in technical interviews. Solving the puzzles helps 
        your thinking skills, and if you're interviewing someone, you may want 
        to select from their list of questions (or modify it slightly based on a 
        theme, etc.).&quot;</blockquote><p>

            <blockquote>&quot;There are some good books to read, too, that you might recommend. 
                K&amp;R has a particularly clever solution to how-many-one-bits, and has, I 
                believe, qsort and dirwalk. Plaugher's <em>The Standard C Library</em> is where 
                I practiced my strings lib functions, and was good reading in general. Jon 
                Bentley has written some books, including <em>Programming Pearls</em> and <em>More 
                    Programming Pearls</em> that are very readable and mildly appropriate to MS 
                interviews. Lastly, there is <em>Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets</em>, by 
                Peter van der Linden, published by Sun Soft Press. It has an unforgettable 
                orange cover with a blue fish on it, that is excellent reading overall, but in 
                particular has a whole appendix with questions and answers for techie 
                interviews.&quot;</blockquote>
