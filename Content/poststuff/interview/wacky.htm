            Why Does Microsoft Ask These Wacky Questions?
        </h1>
        Finally, someone with an explanation of why Microsoft asks these wacky 
        questions!
        <p>
            <blockquote>&quot;Okay, so I'm just a lousy MS contractor (ie, peon). And an 
                anonymous peon, if you see fit to quote me. Nonetheless, your interview page is 
                pretty interesting to read; it's always fun to see how the rest of the world 
                regards things which are uniquely (or relatively) familiar to oneself, right? I 
                have a couple favorite questions I'd love to see added to your page, except 
                that because I made them up myself, I would prefer that they find their own way 
                there. It's more gratifying that way.
                <p>
                My real point in writing is this:
                <p>
                All of those questions are secondary to what I perceive as the one truly 
                important thing in an MS interview... See, they don't really care much about 
                whether or not one answers the question(s) correctly. While they are more 
                interested in the approach that one takes to the problem (eg, are you creative, 
                clever, efficient, elegant, etc), that is also secondary. This is what is 
                absolutely key: they want to know what is on your mind. <-- note the period.
                <p>
                The interviewer doesn't want to spend his time trying to figure out where the 
                line is between what you know and what you can intuit on the spot. He wants to 
                know what you're like, not what you think you should be like. While it might 
                seem obvious that authenticity is vital, many people still get the misguided 
                impression that there is a character type they must reflect. The real truth is 
                that if the interviewer ever gets the slightest feeling that you aren't for 
                real, it's over, and no amount of knowledge or intellect on the part of the 
                candidate can change that.&quot;
