<h1>Thinking &quot;out of the box&quot;</h1>
<p>Here's a story from &quot;Fred&quot; (not his real name):</p>
<p>&quot;I made the mistake of not thinking 'out of the box.' It was a PM role. The 
recruiter said that the hiring manager (whom I interviewed with) was looking for 
someone with very strong process skills (MSF). So naturally I answered the 
questions from a fundamental development process standpoint. This was against my 
normal 'out of the box' style and was later told by the recruiter that the 
manager said I did not have the 'out of the box' Microsoft quality they were 
looking for!</p>
<p>&quot;My answers were along these lines...</p>
<p>&quot;'Well... I would probably query the user community and find out how they 
currently use (or do not use) such products and then incorporate the feedback 
into a set of requirements that would drive a couple prototypes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After talking to some of my programmer friends at MS I was told that the 
correct answer would have been... '[ed: answer deleted to protect readers from 
memorizing answers instead of answering from their heart]' (this would have been 
my answer except that I assumed the hiring manager was looking for a &quot;Status 
Quo&quot; and &quot;Process Driven&quot; candidate... so I answered accordingly)</p>
<p>&quot;Live and learn... Next time I interview with MS I will be a bit more off the 
wall and creative in my answers.&quot;</p>
