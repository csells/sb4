            <blockquote>&quot;This was about the most uncommon set of interviews I had ever 
                had. When I interviewed for Microsoft I didn't go to the Redmond campus instead 
                they flew me down to Las Colinas TX. I was interviewing for a Developer Support 
                position. Most of the interviews were normal except for the extremely long wait 
                periods in between because it seemed everybody that was supposed to interview 
                me either didn't show up or was too busy. So Microsoft had to find 
                &quot;other&quot; employees to interview me.

                    &quot;The most interesting one though was when one of the managers that was 
                    supposed to interview me was stuck in meetings so I think they grabbed the 
                    first cubicle they came to. He walked in with a few loose sheets of paper and 
                    asked if I had a resume. He asked me what I was interviewing for and looked at 
                    my resume. A minute later he looked up and told me he was unsure why he was 
                    interviewing me because my knowledge and his department were unrelated. Then he 
                    told me he was quite put out because he had just bought a six pack and was 
                    drinking it in his cubicle before he was pushed into this interview. I asked 
                    him if he drank often at work and he said quite a bit. I don't know if this is 
                    common but I found it quite interesting.&quot;
