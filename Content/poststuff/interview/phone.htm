            Sample Microsoft Phone Interview
        </h1>
        Here's a true (and funny) sample phone interview from &quot;Bob&quot; (not his 
        real name):</p>
        <blockquote>One evening I decided to cruise Microsoft's online job openings 
            database. Lo and behold, I found a job that sounded interesting (developing SDK 
            material in support of their roll out of CryptoAPI and other security 
            technologies). Off my resume went and about two weeks later, I got a call from 
            someone at Microsoft HR, wanting to know if they could do a phone interview the 
            following week... Sure, no problem. At the appointed hour, the phone rings and 
            I answer. It's a lady from HR to do the interview. We cover some background, 
            where I went to school, degrees, the stuff at the top of the resume, et cetera. 
            Then she asks me about my current employer. I tell her I work for the DoD. Then 
            the fun begins...
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> DoD who?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            Department of Defense, part of the U.S. Government.
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> Oh, I don't think I've heard of them. What do 
                they do?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            (Long answer here referring to the Federal Governs, Department of Defense, 
            Army, Navy, Air Force, civilian employees [I am civilian], Computer Security 
            research, yada yada yada. She's taking notes.)
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> How many commercial products have you shipped?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            None.
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> None? I thought you said you had developed 
                software and products.
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            I did, but none of them are &quot;commercial.&quot; You asked how many 
            &quot;commercial products.&quot; I work for the Government, we aren't 
            commercial, QED.
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> Who did you say you worked for?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font> D-E-P-A-R-T-M-E-N-T O-F D-E-F-E-N-S-E.
            </p>
            <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> What did they do again?
            <br>
            <font color="0000FF">A:</font> (Repeat above.)
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> OK. What would you do if you were given 2 weeks 
                to do a project that you knew would take 3 weeks?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            Tell management that it's a 3 week job, estimate how much I can get done in 2 
            weeks, give 110% and crank out as much as possible.
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> But what if they want it all?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            Tell them to give me more people on the project and we'll give it a shot.
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> You can't get more people, you have to do it 
                with the team you have. What else would you do?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            Well, then I will tell management that its not all going to get done and make 
            sure that they are kept aware of the minute details and get as much done as 
            possible.
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> OK... (very non-committal). How many commercial 
                products have you shipped?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            umm, None. (Repeat above.)
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> Oh yeah, OK. So, according to your resume, I see 
                you have done team management and software development. What are you doing now?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            (Tell her about research project into using Windows NT to its fullest security 
            potential and trying to figure out what to do to make using it even better.)
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> So what are you actually producing with this 
                research?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            Research papers.
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> For who? Who's going to read them?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            Microsoft for one, at least I hope they read them, Netscape, Sun and anybody 
            else who picks up the proceedings where they might be published. Plus we intend 
            to publish on the World Wide Web.
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> Oh, so you don't really have a customer?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            No, err Yes, err whatever. I have a customer, the Government. I am my own 
            customer.
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> Oh. How many commercial products have you 
                shipped?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            (By this time I've clued in that this lady wants to check off a check box on a 
            form in front of her something fierce! But I'm getting REAL annoyed. Repeat 
            above, again.)
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> What do you think of deadlines?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            Deadlines amuse me.
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> Oh! What?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            I do research, I don't have deadlines or schedules. You can't mandate 
            creativity.
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> Oh, I see. Do you have any questions?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            Not right now.
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font> Do you have any concerns?
                <br>
                <font color="0000FF">A:</font>
            Yes, this thing about deadlines. I'm not sure I can handle going from working 
            for the worlds biggest non-profit organization to a commercial software 
            company. It's a big switch.
            <p>
                <font color="0000FF">Q:</font>
            Non-profit organization? Who did you say you worked for?
            <p>
                <br>
            That's pretty much it. You can just imagine how much I was expecting a job 
            offer from Microsoft.
            <p>
            Interesting note for your Interview Tips, I talked with the engineers at 
            Microsoft that I have occasion to work with now and again. They suggest that my 
            first and biggest mistake was sending my resume to Human Resources. They said I 
            should have sent it to them, since they would have been the people I would be 
            working with anyway (and probably interviewing with if I had survived the HR 
            weed out). My &quot;unqualified&quot; status gave them a chuckle, since I had 
            been providing review and feedback on their designs for over a year. So anyway, 
            now I have to wait at least a year for my name and resume to drop out of the 
            database. They think that black mark might be highly insurmountable right now.
            <p>
            A few months later I was at Microsoft as the guest of one of their chief 
            architects (or some such title... he reports to a VP directly). I told him that 
            I had interviewed with Microsoft, but that I wasn't qualified to work there (he 
            chuckled). I said, &quot;There was one question during the interview that I'm 
            still not sure what the correct answer is. What would you say the correct 
            answer to 'What do you think of deadlines?' might be?&quot; He replied, &quot;I 
            have no idea.&quot; I answered, &quot;I can tell you its not 'Deadlines amuse 
            me.'&quot;
