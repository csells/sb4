<h1>Playing a &quot;Meta-Puzzle&quot;</h1>
<p>From &quot;Fred&quot; (not his real name):</p>
<p>&quot;I don't much care for their puzzle-based interview culture, so I did
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.fortune.com/indext.jhtml?channel=print_article.jhtml&doc_id=00003138">
as J Allard suggests</a>, and played a 'meta-puzzle:' I tried to answer at least 
one question, correctly, in a way that my interviewer had not heard before, and 
would not (immediately) understand! And I think I succeeded, with the good 'ol 
triple-xor-register-swap trick:</p>
<p>&quot;Q: Write a C++ function to reverse the characters in a string. Optimize.</p>
<p>&quot;A: [ed: clever answer using XOR]</p>
<p>&quot;After explaining the funky exclusive-or logic, and how this allows an optimizer to 
'save' a cpu register, my interviewer immediately left, and returned with his manager in tow... Hmm.. does this mean I get the job? ;-)&quot;</p>
