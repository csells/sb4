            What's a Program Manager?
        </h1>
        Microsoft has this strange title -- Program Manager -- that seems to fit 
        legions of their employees. I asked Fred if he knew what it meant and he did:
        <p>
            <blockquote>&quot;Program Managers (PMs) analyze one specific feature area within 
                one application unique to Microsoft. They communicate with software design 
                engineers, testers, user education, documentation, marketing, etc. PMs define 
                the features to be implemented, determine which bugs to fix and what upgrades 
                to perform. They establish the schedule and determine when the product may be 
                shipped to the consumer. They create prototypes (usually with Visual BASIC) and 
                play with the latest build to determine progress and get new ideas. As well, 
                PMs listen in on support calls, rummage through user feedback databases, etc. 
                Communication skills, management ability, and common sense are the primary 
                qualifications of a PM.&quot;
