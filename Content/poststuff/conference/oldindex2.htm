          <li>[The] Web Service DevCon was one of the best conference I have 
          ever attended, and hosting the conference here on the East Coast would 
          be outstanding.</li>
          <li>Dude this was excellent! Count me in for the next year's 
          conference.</li>
          <li>This was a very difficult topic to have a focused conference on. I 
          thought the topics were generally very good. Overall good breadth of 
          topics. Thanks for a pleasant experience.</li>
          <li>Yeah!</li>
          <li>Please do this again soon! Don't wait 3 years! The real value of 
          this conference is the change to hear intelligent people talk about 
          different aspects of the technology. This wasn't a training conference 
          -- it's more of a &quot;pulse of the technology&quot; conferences. That's what 
          makes it so useful. Good training classes are commonplace -- this kind 
          of meeting is priceless. Great job! Thanks!</li>
          <li>This has been the most focused, most useful conference I have ever 
          attended. Big thanks for putting on this event.</li>
          <li>Excellent job hitting many aspects of the WS world. Great 
          speakers.</li>
          <li>Good fricking conference.</li>
          <li>I'd attend again!</li>
          <li>Great food.</li>
          <li>Thanks for putting so much work into the conference - it was very 
          educational for me!</li>
          <li>Great job on catering vegetarian lunches.</li>
          <li>I enjoyed the conference tremendously. Very nice topics.</li>
          <li>Awesome conference. Best money my employer every spent. : ) 
          Definitely want to come to the next one.</li>
          <li>Great conference. Please have it annually.</li>
          <li>Thanks Chris + Tim!</li>
          <li>I mainly came here to learn what technologies I'm going to need to 
          learn in the next couple of years, not really to learn the 
          technologies themselves. In that regard the DevCon was a huge success 
          as far as I am concerned.</li>
          <li>Great conference. Surprisingly relevant and interesting, giving 
          the depth and breadth of &quot;web services.&quot; Definitely would be 
          interested in a future conference.</li>
          <li>Really appreciate the timeliness of all of the sessions.</li>
          <li>Awesome. Can't wait for the next one.</li>
          <li>Excellent conference. Well worth the bucks. Looking forward to 
          another conference soon.</li>
          <li>The overall quality of the conference and speakers was excellent. 
          I wouldn't hesitate to come for any future devcon put on by Sells 
          Brothers.</li>
          <li>Perfect.</li>
          <li>Awesome collection of talent!</li>
          <li>Having attended both the ATL DevCon and this one, I have the 
          utmost respect for y'alls' ability to cut to the important info. As 
          always, the talk spread is very nice in that not all speakers are 
          professional speakers/trainers. I can't wait for the next one. : )</li>
          <li>Schedule -- great. Speakers -- star-studded array. Would I attend 
          again? -- yes, especially with these speakers.</li>
          <li>Bob is excellent!</li>

            About Keynote, Don Box:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Don had his visionary goggles on as usual.</li>
          <li>Caused me to rethink a lot of things.</li>
          <li>Don is Don. What more can you say?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            About .NET Web Service interop in the real world, Tim Ewald</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Tim is a master at this subject. He knows more about this area 
          than just about anyone.</li>
          <li>Wish I'd heard this a month ago!</li>
          <li>Tim did a great job high-lighting the current problems in web 
          services dev toolsets.</li>
          <li>[Tim Ewald is a ] smart dude. A real machine.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            About Comparing the Two .NET SOAP Stacks, Brent Rector</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Brent is the man!</li>
          <li>Excellent. Very good. Outstanding speaker. I loved it.</li>
          <li>Love the wise owl -- hoot hoot.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            About &quot;When Web Services Go Bad,&quot; Steve Loughran</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Like this topic Real world web services! Baby!</li>
          <li>Great talk!</li>
          <li>Outstanding.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            About &quot;Network infrastructure requirements for web services,&quot; Eugene 
            Kuznetsov</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Wow!</li>
          <li>Eugene is an engaging/entertaining speaker.</li>
          <li>This talk is a nice dose of reality injected into our fantasy 
          development utopia.</li>
          <li>This is great stuff. Very eye opening.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            About &quot;Unusual applications of web services&quot;, Patrick Logan</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>This was mind-shifting powerful stuff. I didn't expect that any 
          speaker would change the way I think about WS, but Patrick did.</li>
          <li>The sleeper hit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            About &quot;SOAP over alternate protocols,&quot; Peter Drayton</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>This talk really rocked!</li>
          <li>Where do you find these experts? I think it's clear that Peter has 
          no life, but to master all of these technologies. His &quot;hobbies&quot; make 
          for a great session.</li>
          <li>This permanently changed the way I will think about not only WS, 
          but about cracking design problems in the future.</li>
          <li>This talk was useful because of the .NET remoting information, but 
          it was also very cool!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            About &quot;Implementing GXA specifications on .NET,&quot; Keith Ballinger</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A peek into the future. Hopefully I won't have to worry about this 
          stuff, but I'm glad that madmen like Keith are working on it.</li>
          <li>Exactly what I needed to hear!</li>
          <li>Keith rocks!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            About &quot;Using XSLT to implement web services,&quot; Craig Andera</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Great talk. I finally appreciate XML out of SQL Server. Great 
          demos!</li>
          <li>Craig is a mater of this stuff and very &quot;jacked&quot; about the 
          benefits. This was an &quot;incubator&quot; session in that it got me thinking 
          about applications.</li>
