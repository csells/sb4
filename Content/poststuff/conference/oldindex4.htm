          &quot;The DevCon was a great conference. The speakers were top notch, 
          interesting, and dynamic. It was truly a life-changing experience for 
          me.&quot;</li>

          Alexis Smirnov</a>: &quot;This conference blew me away. It was at once 
          exciting and humbling to spend two full days in the company of real 
          experts. The energy in the room was truly amazing – there was zero 
          marketing bs, no Java-vs-CLR religion, the audience was engaged in 
          every talk, complementing it with questions and comments.&quot;</li>
          <li>The level of speakers at this conference is so much higher than 
          any other I have ever attended, [that] Chris &amp; Tim should invent a new word 
          for the event</li>
          <li>This was [an] interesting conference. Great job! Will come back!</li>
          <li>What was most interesting was hearing where [the] best thinkers at 
          major vendors and standards organizations are headed</li>
          <li>Great conference. Being involved in the grind of day to day 
          business, it's good to be able to just think about the big picture for 
          two days. Thanks</li>
          <li>Even better than the first one! Perhaps my most peak conference 
          experience!</li>
          <li>This conference absolutely rocked</li>
          <li>Great content. Obviously, this is <u>the</u> conference for this 
          stuff. Good number of WS big wheels speaking</li>
          <li>I liked the real-world sessions that discussed practical 
          implementations of web services</li>
          <li>When is the next one? Sign me up!</li>
          <li>Good job! Do it again! The best mix of speakers and topics I have 
          seen in a long time</li>
          <li>Great conference. First time I sat through all (OK, almost all : ) 
          talks</li>
          <li>Fantastic. Most useful conference in last two years!</li>
          <li>This conference was great! It was reaffirming to hear industry 
          experts validating the work I've been doing while providing insight + 
          direction in some new areas. Keep 'em coming!</li>
          <li>Although I am new to web service[s], I can safely say that I am 
          leaving with a wealth of knowledge in a two day period that only years 
          of exposure can provide. I look forward to attending the next one</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>About Keynote, Sam Ruby</h2>

          <li>Sam Ruby is an authority in all things web service and this talk 
          re-enforced that. He fundamentally changed the way I look at SOAP</li>
          <li>Sam's talk was a great intro + foundation. It validated that 
          [this] conference was the right choice for me</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>About Designing a RESTful SOAP API, Peter Drayton</h2>
        <ul>

          issues AND offered some great guidelines to follow</li>

          <li>The speaker did [an] exceptional job</li>
          <li>Lots of practical guidelines from someone who learned it the hard 
          way!</li>

          presentation</li>

          application for me</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>About Web Services in the Doctor's Office, Dr. Aleksey Nudelman</h2>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <h2>About .NET, XSLT, and Web Services, Christopher Dix</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>This talk rocked!</li>
          <li>Not sure if I should be horrified or impressed with the work Chris 
          did</li>
          <li>What a freak! I know XSLT could do some great stuff, but this? I 
          never thought this would be so doable</li>
          <li>Great presentation of an alternate approach offered new insight 
          into XSLT</li>

          VS.NET?</li>
          <li>Yassar did an excellent job of showing how to do web services 
          right</li>
          <li>This talk got me thinking. It's a great way, and I agree the right

          <li>One of the most important talks at this conference</li>

        <h2>About Web Services Diagnostics, David Seidel &amp; Mark Ericson</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The speakers were superb. They could have presented just their 
          tool but they fairly showed all the tools they knew. And their tool 
          rocks!</li>
          <li>It was great to see [a] tool vendor not trying to push their own 
          tools, but rather help people with choosing tools</li>
          <li>An interesting project and a useful overview of diagnostic 
          techniques</li>
        </ul>

          <li>I definitely did <u>NOT</u> want Tim's talk to end</li>
          <li>Geez, Tim is good! Funny, interesting, thought-provoking. He's a 
          skilled presenter</li>
          <li>Interesting view on how XML [to] object mapping loses the ability 
          to use keen XML languages/tools</li>
          <li>Fantastic!</li>
          <li>Excellent! This is exactly the kind of information I was looking 
          for</li>
        </ul>

        Kuznetsov</h2>
