        TAPI is based on the principles of the Windows Open Services Architecture 
        (WOSA). TAPI provides some central services and holds some global state. Its 
        main purpose, however, is to provide connections between TAPI Service Providers 
        (TSPs) and TAPI applications. Applications are programmed using TAPI. TSPs 
        implement the Telephony Service Provider Interface (TSPI) functions that are 
        used by the TAPI implementation. Each TSP then uses whatever interface is 
        appropriate to control its telephony hardware. Together, it looks like this:

            This layered approach makes it possible for an application to be developed 
            without worrying about the specific hardware provided on a particular machine. 
            Any telephony hardware vendor can then implement the appropriate parts of the 
            TSPI without worrying about what telephony applications have been installed. 
            This separation gives both applications and hardware independence from each 
            other. Applications and hardware can come and go without directly affecting one 
            another.

            The WOSA model is used to achieve the goals of the TAPI, which are:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Call control focused.
            </li>
            <li>
                Access to data via existing standard APIs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Network independence.
            </li>
            <li>
                Connection model independence.
            </li>
            <li>
                Platform independence where possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sharing of lines between multiple applications.
            </li>
        </ol>
