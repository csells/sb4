        The term "telephony" simply refers to the connection of computers and 
        telephones. This kind of connection is useful for all kinds of things <font face="Symbol">
            -</font> placing, answering, routing and monitoring phone calls, taking 
        information from a caller via touch-tones, voice recordings or voice 
        recognition, et cetera. Many different kinds of applications can be built using 
        telephony features. Personal Information Managers (PIMs) and productivity 
        applications, like word processors and spreadsheets, can provide support for 
        dialing selected phone numbers. A call manager application could provide help 
        for those of us who can never remember how to transfer or set up a conference 
        call. A call manager could be especially smart and use Caller-ID information to 
        show who was calling, even if we are already on another call.
        <p>
        There are also several kinds of applications that don't require a human on both 
        sides of the call. If you like, you can install an application on your computer 
        that will answer the phone when you call and provide access to what I like to 
        call "Excel From Abroad." By using touch-tones or your voice, you can access 
        the data on your computer from any phone in the world. A computer with multiple 
        phone lines can provide an Integrated Voice Response (IVR) application. IVR 
        applications include auto-attendants to route phone calls, voice mail systems 
        to take messages and audiotex systems to provide information from your local 
        bank or newspaper.
        <p>
        Or, we could use the phone as a microphone and speaker without involving the 
        telephone network at all.
