            For an ISV to be able to cover enough of a market to make a difference, all of 
            the telephone network communication protocols had to be covered with a single 
            API: POTS, PBX, ISDN, key systems, wireless, cellular and even the LAN (Local 
            Area Network). TAPI provides a super-set API to functionality provided for all 
            of these networks, abstracted in a way that isn't tied to a specific one. 
            Telephony devices provide access to the various features of their networks 
            without requiring the application to have specific knowledge related to each 
            one.
            <p>
                Unfortunately, because TAPI has be a super-set of the functionality of every 
                kind of telephone network, the API is rather large. All telephony devices can't 
                support all of the functionality accessible via TAPI. Applications need to be 
                aware of this and write applications that provide sub-sets of functionality 
                based on the capabilities of the system's telephony devices. The good news is 
                that TAPI allows an application to get a complete description of telephony 
                device capabilities at runtime.
