        The Telephony API was designed to provide call control and media access to 
        line, phone, address and call objects over multiple telephone networks using 
        many different kinds of connections models. It was designed to be platform 
        independent, but has only been implemented for various flavors of Windows. To 
        overcome specific device sharing problems encountered in Windows 3.x, TAPI 
        provides extensive support for sharing using line ownership privileges.
