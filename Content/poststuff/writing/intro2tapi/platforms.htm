        Developers exist for every computer platform and every operation system there 
        is. Ideally, the TAPI designers wanted to create a PC standard for telephony 
        programming that worked across computers and operating systems. However, 
        because it was Intel and Microsoft doing the design, they wanted to solve the 
        problem for Windows first. Unfortunately, TAPI hasn't yet made it to other 
        platforms, but it works on Windows 3.x, Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0.
