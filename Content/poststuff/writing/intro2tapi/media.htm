            While TAPI was designed from the ground up for call control, it has no facility 
            for direct access to the <i>media</i> available on a call, address, line or 
            phone. The media is the data available, e.g. modem, fax, network, voice, et 
            cetera. The designers of TAPI had a choice to make when they decided how to 
            provide access to media via TAPI. One option was to add whole sub-sets of 
            functionality to the API for each kind of media. This would require ISVs to 
            learn these media access sub-APIs. It would also require that TAPI be updated 
            every time a new kind of media appeared.
            <p>
                Another option <font face="Symbol">-</font> the one they chose <font face="Symbol">-</font>
                was to provide a way of getting at a specific <i>API handle</i> for use with an 
                existing or future media API. The API handle could then be used in subsequent 
                calls to the media API. This doesn't require ISVs to learn new APIs nor does it 
                require TAPI to change when a new media type is developed. Instead, if a device 
                supports a specific kind of media, it simply provides an API handle for that 
                media type when asked.

                Media types are described by <i>device classes</i>. A device class is a 
                description of a device that provides access to a specific type of media. A <i>device 
                    class name</i> is simply a string identifying a specific device class. The 
                device classes defined for TAPI are:

            If a telephony device doesn't support a specific class of media, it will simply 
            fail when asked to provide an API handle. If a telephony vendor wants to 
            support a device class other than those shown here, it can do so and provide 
            documentation for that device class.
