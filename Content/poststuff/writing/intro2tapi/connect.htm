            The layer of abstraction between applications and hardware that TAPI provides 
            allows for a single programming model no matter how the hardware has been 
            connected to the user's PC. The TAPI Specification lists several possible 
            examples of connection models. Ultimately, however, as long as the programming 
            model remains consistent, a hardware vendor is free to provide a connection in 
            any way that makes sense. Several of the popular connection models are 
            described below.

                The phone-centric model is the one most liked by people in the phone hardware 
                business. The focus on this model, as the name states, is the phone. The phone 
                line from the wall is connected to the desktop phone. Then phone is then 
                connected to the PC via some kind of digital connection. The phone controls the 
                calls and the PC directs the phone. For example, the AT&amp;T 8130 is a 
                two-line phone that connects to the PC via a serial cable. It comes with a TSP 
                that provides access to both phone lines. However, the phone has a lot of 
                features <font face="Symbol">-</font> Caller-ID display, speed dial memory, 
                hold, mute, volume, et cetera <font face="Symbol">-</font> all of which are 
                available without help from the PC.
            </p>
            <p>
                This model works equally well for whatever kind of phone <font face="Symbol">-</font>
                POTS, Centrex, ISDN, PBX-specific, cellular <font face="Symbol">-</font> the 
                computer is connected to. To get most of the functionality out of the phone in 
                this model, the PC doesn't even have to be on.

                PC manufacturers like the computer-centric connection model. In this model, the 
                phone line is connected directly to the computer via some telephony hardware 
                like a modem or an ISDN adapter card. The computer is the brains of this model 
                and the phone (sometimes called the <i>down-line phone</i>) simply acts as a 
                microphone and speaker. In this model, the PC essentially replaces the phone. 
                Of course, for this to work, the PC has to be on.

                Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 come with a built-in TSP called Unimodem. This 
                TSP has a giant database of modem-specific AT commands to direct a modem 
                through a phone call. Because most modem hardware is limited when it comes to 
                voice calls, however, Unimodem makes a poor TSP. Some modems provide voice 
                support via proprietary extensions or by implementing an AT command extension 
                set called AT+V (AT plus Voice). The TSP Unimodem/V provides special support 
                for these voice modems.

                In this model, the desktop PC and the phone aren't even directly connected. 
                Instead, a server on the LAN connects to the phone switch <font face="Symbol">-</font>
                a PBX <font face="Symbol">-</font> via some kind of digital link. The desktop 
                PC connects to the server via the LAN and directs it to control calls. The 
                server passes these commands to the switch which controls the phone on the same 
                desktop as the PC. Unlike the previous two models, which use 1<sup>st</sup>-party 
                call control, this is a 3<sup>rd</sup>-party call control model.

                            Each connected phone call has at least two parties, one on each end. Each 
                            party, whether a person or a computer, has control of one end of the call. 1<sup>st</sup>-party 
                            call control means that the control of the call rests solely with the party 
                            participating on the call. No one else controls the connection. If the call is 
                            transferred somewhere else, control is lost and given to the transferee. 3<sup>rd</sup>-party 
                            call control, however, means that the end-point of the call shares control with 
                            another.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, in the LAN connection model, the end-point of the call is the 
                            desktop phone, which has 1<sup>st</sup>-party control. The desktop PC has 3<sup>rd</sup>-party 
                            call control by talking to the switch, via the server PC, to control the call. 
                            This means that you could disconnect your end of the call by hanging up the 
                            phone (1<sup>st</sup>-party call control) or by sending a hang-up signal to the 
                            switch from your desktop PC (3<sup>rd</sup>-party call control).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What about 2<sup>nd</sup>-party call control? There is no such thing.
                        </p>

            For the LAN connection model, the TSP provided on the desktop PC is not talking 
            to a phone, but rather to the server PC on the LAN. This model typically limits 
            access to the data on the call. The bandwidth required to send data or voice 
            between the switch and the server PC and between the server PC and the desktop 
            PC isn't that much. However, when combined with existing LAN traffic and 
            multiplied by everyone on the phone, access to the data on a phone call is a 
            luxury most LAN and switch managers are not willing to provide.
            <p>
                The main benefit of this model is that no additional hardware is required on 
                the desktop PC to make it work. A desktop PC connected to the LAN can control 
                the desktop phone with some additional software <font face="Symbol">-</font> specifically 
                a TSP. Once the server PC is connected to the switch, everyone can control 
                their phone from their desktop.

                This model is used for IVR applications. A bank that needs to provide account 
                information to its customers or an automated operator run by the local phone 
                company will use this model. The server PC is connected to the switch by 
                several phone lines. The server PC controls the calls on these lines using 1<sup>st</sup>-party 
                call control. It can play messages, take input and provide information. You can 
                think of these systems just like any other kind of PC server, except instead of 
                using a local area network connection to communicate with its clients, it uses 
                a telephone network connection.
