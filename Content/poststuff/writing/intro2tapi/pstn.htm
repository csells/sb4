            The existing Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is usually represented in 
            a picture like this:

        Most homes are connected to the Central Office (CO) via an analog POTS line. If 
        you disconnect the wire from the back of your home phone, you're likely see 
        four wires held in place by a plastic RJ-11 connector. The inner pair of wires 
        is for line one and the outer pair is for line two. Each wire in the pair has a 
        name (tip and ring), and the two together provide a complete connection to the 
        local CO <font face="Symbol">-</font> giving rise to the name of this 
        connection: the local loop. Each pair of wires transmits voice, tones and 
        power. The tones consist of both Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) tones you 
        send by pressing the buttons on your touch-tone keypad and information tones 
        from the CO. The power is used to ring your phone and keep it working when your 
        home&#146;s power is out (otherwise, how could you call and complain?). Even 
        data from a fax machine or a modem is translated into voice energy <font face="Symbol">
            -</font> which sounds like static <font face="Symbol">-</font> before it's 
        sent over the line.
        <p>
            The connection between the COs around the world inside of the PSTN cloud has 
            long since been converted from analog to digital. There's just too much 
            information being sent to leave it all in analog format. Instead, the voice 
            energy on the line is sampled, turned into 1s and 0s and sent as data via a 
            protocol called Signaling System 7 (SS7). Once the data reaches the CO on the 
            other end of the connection, the data is turned back into voice and sent down 
            the final mile of the local loop.

                        The word modem stands for <u>mo</u>dulation-<u>dem</u>odulation. Modulation 
                        happens when digital data is translated into analog signals for your POTS phone 
                        line. Demodulation happens on the receiving side to translate the analog 
                        signals back into digital data. Modem speeds have continued to rise over the 
                        years because engineers at the phone company (AT&amp;T mostly <font face="Symbol">-</font>
                        <u>the</u> phone company) have found ways to increase the speed of the 
                        modulation-demodulation process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The irony is that because the PSTN cloud is now digital, the local CO must turn 
                        the modulated data back into bits before sending it to the remote CO. The 
                        remote CO must then turn it back into an analog signal, send it down the line 
                        to the modem which then demodulates it back into bits. It's no wonder modern 
                        modems have so many fancy error correction protocols.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, why have the AT&amp;T engineers been spending all their time making modems 
                        faster? Shouldn't they be replacing the analog local loop and saving all of the 
                        unnecessary translating back and forth between analog and digital? 
                        Unfortunately, it's currently cheaper for them to leave the existing copper 
                        wire then to replace it with fiber optic cabling. Maybe the cable company can 
                        help...

        Because the PSTN is all digital, and a digital connection has so much more 
        bandwidth and capability than an analog connection, businesses have used 
        various flavors of digital connections in the local loop for years. These are 
        connections with names like T1, T3 and Switched-56. For businesses with lots of 
        phone lines and lots of money, these are wonderful inventions. For homes in the 
        '90s with personal computers, and limited spending capacity, these have been 
        solutions out of reach. However, one affordable solution has been available for 
        quite a while now <font face="Symbol">-</font> the Integrated Services Digital 
        Network (ISDN <font face="Symbol">-</font> sometimes expanded to It Still Does 
        Nothing or I Still Don't kNow by the bitter proponents of other standards).
        <p>
            ISDN is an international standard with two major flavors, BRI-ISDN (Basic Rate 
            Interface) and PRI-ISDN (Primate Rate Interface). BRI-ISDN consists of 2B+D <font face="Symbol">
                -</font> two bearer channels and one data channel. Each bearer channel is 
            for data up to 64 Kbps (kilobits per second), including voice, fax, video, 
            network packets, et cetera. Combined, the two B-channels can provide up to 128 
            Kbps, more than four times as much as the 28.8 Kbps analog modem. In addition, 
            the D-channel can provide 16Kbps, but is usually used only for call-related 
            information, e.g. announcing a new call, placing a new call, et cetera. 
            BRI-ISDN is great for a small business or a well-wired home. It's fairly well 
            supported by computer and phone manufacturers and is relatively inexpensive (at 
            least when compared to other options). For larger businesses, and more money, 
            PRI-ISDN provides 23B+D.
        </p>

            POTS provides the capability to answer and receive a call and more recently has 
            provided for Caller-ID. However, to be able to transfer a call, put a call on 
            hold or place a call with more than one other participant <font face="Symbol">-</font>
            a conference call <font face="Symbol">-</font> you're going to need more than 
            POTS. Most COs provide an additional set of advanced call control capabilities 
            grouped together into a service called Centrex. This service extends the 
            advanced functionality found on larger business phone lines to your home or 
            small business. By providing these features on its own switch equipment, the CO 
            can often provide them more cheaply and more easily than having your own 
            switch.
        </p>
        <p>
            A switch provides the brains of any phone connection. If you've picked up a 
            phone and you hear a dial tone, that's the switches signal that it's ready to 
            do your bidding. With POTS, ISDN and Centrex, the switch is located at the CO. 
            However, if you'd like, you can have your own switch. Owning your own switch 
            means that you control it completely. If you'd like an analog connection 
            between your switch and the phones it supports, you're going to be using a Key 
            System. A Key System is very much like having your own personal Centrex. 
            However, because it's analog, and typically doesn't support many phones, a Key 
            System is fairly limited. If, instead, you'd like a digital connection between 
            the switch and the phones it supports, and you'd like to support more phones, 
            you want a PBX (Private Branch eXchange). Because a PBX is digital, it's more 
            flexible and more full-featured.

            Each of the switches involved in any of the types of telephone networks I've 
            mentioned is <font face="Symbol">-</font> surprise, surprise <font face="Symbol">-</font>
            a computer. These computers typically have a closed architecture, which means 
            that the only one who can add features or fix bugs is the manufacturer of the 
            switch. However, the features provided by switches are limited by the fact that 
            they are implemented on proprietary computers. Other companies are beginning to 
            realize this and provide switches based on general purpose computers, i.e. PCs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using standard interfaces for hardware and software, switches can be controlled 
            via network protocols of all kinds. This includes traditional telephone 
            networks like POTS, ISDN and Centrex as well as PC networks using protocols 
            like TCP/IP (the language of the Internet) and IPX/SPX (the protocol used by 
            Novell's Netware product). The software programming standard that makes all of 
            these protocols available for telephony applications under Windows is TAPI, the 
            Telephony Application Programming Interface.
