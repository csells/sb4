		<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><b>A.</b> <P>An object of type "String" in C# is an object of type "System.String", and it's bound that way by the compiler if you use a "using System" directive, like so:</P><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>
<P><STRONG>using</STRONG></FONT><FONT size=2><STRONG> System;<BR></STRONG>...<BR><FONT size=2><STRONG>String s = "Hi";<BR></STRONG>Console.WriteLine(s);</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>If you were to remove the "using System" statement, I'd have to write the code more explicitly, like so:</P><FONT size=2><FONT size=2><FONT size=3><FONT size=2>
<P><STRONG>System.String s = "Hi";<BR></STRONG>System.Console.WriteLine(s);</P>
<P>On the other hand, if you use the "string" type in C#, you could skip the "using System" directive and the namespace prefix:</P><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>
<P><STRONG>string</STRONG></FONT><FONT size=2><STRONG> s = "Hi";<BR></STRONG>System.Console.WriteLine(s);</P></FONT></FONT>
<P>The reason that this works and the reason that "object", "int", etc in C# all work is because they're language-specific aliases to underlying .NET Framework types. Most languages have their own aliases that serve as a short-cut and a bridge to the .NET types that existing programmers in those languages understand.</P>
<P>Personally, I prefer to use the aliases instead of the .NET versions because, as an old-time C/C++ programmer, I prefer to type "int" instead of "Int32" etc. However, both are exactly equivalent, so pick the one you like best and stick with it.</P></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></p>
