You can trigger it by choosing File-&gt;Open-&gt;Project from within VS.NET and choosing the .vbp file that represents your VB6 project. Be warned that the wizard can only do so much and that you’re going to have to finish most migrations manually using the 101-Keyboard Wizard and the 2-Button Mouse Wizard that comes with your computer. Check out the _UpgradeReport.htm file that gets generated by the Upgrade Wizard for tips.</SPAN></p>
