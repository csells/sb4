-Does it do trackbacks and pings? Pings would be easy - just the call to one or more services. The only gotcha is that it's XML-RPC, but that's what Cook Computing is for. I've never managed to get my head fully around trackbacks (that was D's mental level, as he's built it a number of times). However, I think it should be worth it, as it allows you to better track people commenting on your post on their blogs.
